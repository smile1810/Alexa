Project Report: Voice Assistant in Python
 1. Introduction
 This project implements a voice assistant using Python. It uses speech recognition to listen for commands,
 text-to-speech for replies, and integrates additional libraries for tasks like playing YouTube videos, fetching
 Wikipedia summaries, and telling jokes.
 2. Objectives- Build an interactive voice assistant - Enable voice-based commands - Use APIs and libraries to perform tasks
 like information retrieval and media playback
 3. System Requirements- Python 3.x - Internet connection - Microphone - Libraries: speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, wikipedia,
 pyjokes
 4. Methodology
 The system listens for input using SpeechRecognition. After recognizing a command, it is processed by
 conditional logic inside the `run_alexa()` function. Depending on keywords such as 'time', 'play', 'who is', or 'joke',
 the assistant performs the required action.
 5. Conclusion
 This project demonstrates a functional voice assistant using Python. The assistant can be expanded further with
 more features such as smart home integration, reminders, or offline speech models
