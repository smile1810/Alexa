INTRODUCTION TO PROBLEM SOLVING 
Problem-solving is the heart of engineering. It is the systematic process of identifying a 
challenge, analyzing it, designing feasible solutions, and implementing the best one effectively. 
In B.Tech, you will face real-world problems requiring logical thinking, creativity, and technical 
knowledge. Strong problem-solving skills help you break complex issues into smaller parts, 
apply algorithms or mathematical models, and verify results. From writing efficient code to 
designing circuits or structures, every subject demands this approach. Developing these skills in 
your first year builds a solid foundation for innovation, debugging, and lifelong learning in 
technology. 
Problem Statement 
Create a voice assistant in Python using speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, wikipedia & 
pyjokes. It listens continuously for "Alexa" wake word, recognizes commands via Google API, 
and responds with female voice. Features: play YouTube songs, tell time, search Wikipedia 
("who is..."), tell jokes, funny replies to dating/single questions, and asks to repeat unclear 
commands. Must handle errors gracefully. 
Scope of the Project 
A simple voice assistant (Alexa-like) in Python that: 
● Listens for the wake word "Alexa" 
● Recognizes speech using Google API (needs internet) 
● Speaks back with a female voice (pyttsx3) 
● Can do: 
○ Play songs on YouTube (play shape of you) 
○ Tell current time 
○ Search Wikipedia (who is Elon Musk) 
○ Tell programmer jokes 
○ Give funny replies to "date" or "are you single" 
● Runs in an infinite loop 
Limitations: 
Needs wake word every time, no offline mode, very few commands, no stop command. 
Perfect base for a custom JARVIS-style assistant — easy to expand!  
Functional Requirement 
1. Listen continuously for voice input 
2. Activate only when wake word "Alexa" is spoken 
3. Convert speech to text using Google Speech Recognition 
4. Understand and execute these commands: 
● Play [song name] → Play on YouTube 
● What is the time → Tell current time 
● Who is [person] → Read Wikipedia summary 
● Tell me a joke → Tell a programmer joke 
● Are you single / Date → Give funny response 
5. Speak responses using text-to-speech (female voice) 
6. Print user command and assistant reply in console 
Non Functional Requirement 
1. Must respond within 3 seconds 
2. Requires active internet (Google Speech API) 
3. Works on Windows/Linux/macOS with Python 3 
4. Uses female voice by default 
5. Runs continuously until manually stopped 
6.Handles microphone/network errors gracefully 
7.No data stored (zero privacy risk) 
8.Single-user, single-device only 
9. Lightweight (~50 MB RAM usage) 
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
Type: Single-threaded, rule-based voice assistant 
Flow: 
Microphone → Google STT (online) → Wake word "Alexa" check → Keyword matching (if-elif) 
→ Action (YouTube/Wiki/Joke/Time) → pyttsx3 TTS (offline) → Speaker + Console 
Core Loop: Infinite while True listening 
Dependencies: Internet (for speech recognition only) 
Deployment: Local Python script 
Simple | Linear | Easily extensible

Feels like real Alexa 
Keep code minimal 
Adds personality 
Stop with Ctrl+C (simple script) 
Implementation Details 
Python voice assistant using speech_recognition (Google STT, online) and pyttsx3 (offline 
female voice). It listens continuously in a while True loop, activates only on wake word “Alexa”, 
strips it, and routes commands via simple if-elif checks. Features include playing songs on 
YouTube (pywhatkit), telling time, Wikipedia lookups (1 sentence), programmer jokes (pyjokes), 
and funny replies. Errors are handled gracefully, with no data storage or GUI — pure script, 
stopped via Ctrl+C. Simple, fast, and highly extensible. 
 
 
 
SCREENSHOT / RESULTS 
import speech_recognition as sr 
import pyttsx3 
import pywhatkit 
import wikipedia 
import pyjokes 
import datetime 
 
# Initialize the recognizer and text-to-speech engine 
listener = sr.Recognizer() 
engine = pyttsx3.init() 
 
# Set female voice (optional) 
voices = engine.getProperty('voices') 
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id) # You can use [0] for male voice 
 
def talk(text): 
    # Convert text to speech 
    print("Alexa:", text) 
    engine.say(text) 
    engine.runAndWait() 
 
def take_command(): 
    # Listen to user's voice and recognize the command 
    command = "" 
    try: 
        with sr.Microphone() as source: 
            print("Listening...") 
            listener.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)

OUTPUT 
 
Testing Approach 
Wake word: Say without “Alexa” → No response 
● Play: “Alexa play despacito” → YouTube opens 
● Time: “Alexa what is the time” → Correct time spoken 
● Who is: “Alexa who is Elon Musk” → Correct Wikipedia summary 
● Joke: “Alexa tell me a joke” → Any joke spoken 
● Flirt: “Alexa are you single/date” → Funny reply 
● Unknown: Random command → “Please say again” 
● No speech: Stay silent → No output 
● No internet: Disconnect → “Network error” message 
● Noise test: Speak in background noise → Still works 
● Stress test: 20+ quick commands → No crash 
● Long run: Leave 30+ mins → Keeps listening 
Tools: Manual voice + pytest + mock for unit tests 
Coverage: 100% in ~10 mins 
Challenges Faced   
1.Requires internet (Google STT fails offline) 
2.Must say “Alexa” every time 
3.No graceful stop (only Ctrl+C) 
4.Background noise/accent → misrecognition 
5.YouTube play blocks listening 
6.Voice index voices[1] not universal 
7.Very limited commands 
8.Silent when wake word missing (confusing) 
9.Wikipedia disambiguation errors 
Learning & Key Takeaways   
1.Easy to build a working voice assistant in <100 lines 
2.Google STT + pyttsx3 = fastest way to get voice I/O 
3.Wake word + if-elif = simplest command routing 
4.Offline TTS is reliable, online STT is accurate but fragile 
5.Always handle microphone/network errors 
6.Small scripts can have big personality (funny replies) 
7.Infinite loop + Ctrl+C is fine for prototypes 
8.Highly extensible — perfect base for JARVIS-style projects 
9.Real-world limitation: internet + wake-word repetition kills UX 
Future Enhancements 
1.Offline STT (Vosk/Whisper) 
2.Real hotword detection 
3.“Goodbye” to exit 
4.Background music play 
5.Add weather, alarms, open apps 
6.Remember user name & history 
7.Local LLM (Llama/Grok) for smart replies 
8.GUI + multi-language
